- Render the subscription and guide labels as clickable links; include full URLs in plain-text hosts. Do not open checkout or place an order automatically.
- Trigger this prompt only from the explicit membership-denial result, not a browser badge, missing membership data, insufficient credits, login failure, or a generic permission error. Keep other error and recovery rules unchanged.
- Use the subscription and guide URLs provided here; do not change their domains based on the user's language.
- Do not add model names unless live CLI discovery confirms availability. Do not promise prices, discounts, free credits, unlimited generation, or a guaranteed support response time.
- After the user subscribes, verify the CLI account and recheck access. A browser account switch or an opened subscription page does not prove that the CLI account changed or that access is enabled. Preserve credit approvals and operation identities.
